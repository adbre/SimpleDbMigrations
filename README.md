1. Add .sql-files in your project as manifest resources
2. Add *R.cs* to the same folder as the .sql-files
```C#
public sealed class R {
	private R() {
		/* Dummy. Placeholder for finding manifest resource prefix. */
	}
}
```
3. Initialize and call migrator during start-up of your program
```C#
var migrator = new DbMigrator("dbo", typeof(R));
migrator.Migrate(connectionString);
```
